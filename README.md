# Team Profile Generator app using Node.js, OOP, TDD

## Desription
This is the solution for the challenge from EdX bootcamp, Week 12. During this week I learnt about OOP and Unit Testing using Jest and successfully applied my new skills to this solution.  
The application uses the Inquirer package to prompt the user for command-line input about employees (such as managers, engineers, and interns), and based on that input, it generates an HTML webpage.  
This webpage displays summaries for each employee, including their names, IDs, email addresses, and specific information related to their roles (e.g., office number for managers, GitHub usernames for engineers, and school information for interns).  
The generated HTML webpage serves as a visual representation of the input provided through the command line, making it easy to view and share employee information in a formatted manner.
